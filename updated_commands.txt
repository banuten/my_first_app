In Angular 8+, the @ViewChild() syntax which you'll see in the next lecture needs to be changed slightly:

Instead of:

@ViewChild('serverContentInput') serverContentInput: ElementRef;
use

@ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static: true}) serverContentInput

The same change (add { static: true } as a second argument) needs to be applied to ALL usages of @ViewChild() (and also @ContentChild() which you'll learn about later) IF you plan on accessing the selected element inside of ngOnInit().

If you DON'T access the selected element in ngOnInit (but anywhere else in your component), set static: false instead!

If you're using Angular 9, you only need to add { static: true } (if needed) but not { static: false }.

In Angular 8+, the @ContentChild() syntax which you'll see in the next lecture needs to be changed slightly:

Instead of:

@ContentChild('contentParagraph') paragraph: ElementRef;
use

@ContentChild('contentParagraph', {static: true}) paragraph: ElementRef;
The same change (add { static: true } as a second argument) needs to be applied to ALL usages of @ContentChild() if you use the selected element inside of ngOnInit (as we do it in the lectures).

If you DON'T use the selected element in ngOnInit, set static: false instead.
